### Setup

When on landing page (see screenshot) the user will be asked to share his current location with the application. If the user declines, he will be asked again to allow to share his location, otherwise the application will not work.
After allowing the sharing of his location, the user is presented with current day's weather and the current date. Additionally the [...] and temperature are displayed.
<br><br>
The User can choose from five different Categories:

* Natural- Geographical
* Leisure - Outdoor
* Museum
* Landmark - Attraction
* Restaurant

Each of this categorizes gives the user a selection of 10 different activities within a 30km radius of his location.
