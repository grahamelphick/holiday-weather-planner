### User story

As a User I would like to plan a great day ahead without any effort. Before making any decision what to do I need to know what the weather forecast is so I can base my choice on it. I would like to choose from different categories and get a small amount of activities and places to visit that I can choose from.

### Setup

When on landing page (see screenshot) the user will be asked to share his current location with the application. If the user declines, he will be asked again to allow to share his location, otherwise the application will not work.
After allowing the sharing of his location, the user is presented with current day's weather and the current date. Additionally the [...] and temperature are displayed.
<br><br>
The User can choose from five different Categories:

* Natural- Geographical
* Leisure - Outdoor
* Museum
* Landmark - Attraction
* Restaurant

Each of this categories gives the user a selection of 10 different activities within a 30km radius of his location.
